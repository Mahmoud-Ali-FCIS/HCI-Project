# Evaluation Metrics

## Acceptability

- **Definintion**: social acceptance is “the absence of social disapproval”[1]

- The success of innovative technologies requires attention to be focused on early adopters of the technology and enthusiasts, rather than general end-users. Therefore, user acceptance should be considered more important than usability and convenience[2].

- Social acceptance is not a one-time decision between acceptable and unacceptable, but rather a “user’s continuous decision process that is influenced by the experiences gathered while performing” [3]

- Davis’ **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)** [4][5] describes the adoption of new technologies by individuals influenced through two main factors:
  - perceived **usefulness** (PU) 
  - perceived **ease-of-use** (PEOU).

## Useability

- **Definintion**: The extent to which a product can be used by specific users to achieve specific goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specific context of use[6].

- Nielsen’s Usability Attributes[7]
  - Learnability
  - Efficiency
  - Memorability
  - Errors prevented
  - Subjective satisfaction

## Conclusion

Usability and Acceptability differ from other system quality measures (such as maintainability, reliability or portability) in the sense that the **user point of view** plays a **determinant** role in it. The objective must not be only to obtain fully functional systems, but also the development of the systems have to adapt to the user needs, expectations and goals[8].
