## Tangible Model Interview

---

### Unstructured interviews

- most like a conversation, often go into depth
- open questions
- exploratory

>absolute key is to listen rather than talk: practice silence!

#### pros/cons

[2]

|   Advantages  |  Limitations  |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| Can provide **more detailed information** than other data collection methods, such as surveys      | Can be **time-intensive** because of the time it takes to conduct interviews, transcribe them, and analyze the results |
| May provide a **more relaxed atmosphere** in which to collect information through conversation, in comparison to filling out a survey  | **Interviewer must be appropriately trained** in interviewing techniques in order to extract the most detailed and rich data from an interviewee  |
| Interviewee can provide firsthand and more personal knowledge of a given topic that was not anticipated by the researcher | Not generalizable; generalizations about the results are usually incapable of being made because small samples are chosen and random sampling methods are not used |
|  | **Prone to bias**; responses from interviewees (community members, program participants, etc) might be biased due to their stake in the program |

### 1. Interview questions about user charastaristic

1. How old are you?
2. What is your gender?(Man - Woman - etc...)
3. Do you need assistance in order to do your daily chores?
4. What is the level of the needed assistance on a scale of 6?
5. How often do you perform these tasks currently?
E.g., how often to you open/close the blinds per day? How often do you turn the TV on and off per day? etc. How do you currently perform these tasks?

<!-- 3. What kind of **physical** disorders do you have?
4. What kind of **cognitive** disorders do you have? -->

> This scale is graduated from 1 to 6, 6 represents independent persons for everyday life activities and 1 represents dependent persons with cognitive, physical, social, significant problems requiring a continued assistance[1].

### 2. Interview questions about Model intuitivity

First we introduce the shape of the model without further explanation, and we ask:

![Tangible Model](/img/Tangible2.jpg)

1. could you tell me what possible meaning of the icons on the panel?</u> Then base on their reply, we can set a score for that. This is for the (ease-of-use evaluation). **( I think the model should be introduced during this question.)**
2. ~~Would you use it in front of visitors? Family? Why? (to evaluate initial acceptability)~~ **same as what would be asked in 3.2**
3. Would you want to do daily jobs with this interface? Eg. TV, blinds, etc. Why?
4. How often would you use this interface compared to the current way you ~~close the blinds~~ do your daily jobs? Why? **(give some examples here, TV, blinds, windows, etc.)**
5. How often do you move from one room to another in your home? Would you take this model with you when you move from one room to another one? Why (not)? (to evaluate portability)
6. ~~ask the user/s to perform some of the gestures so that they can experience it before they comment on it.~~ **Merged into 3.1**

### 3. Interview questions after explaining the describtion

We provide a detailed explanasion about the Model, and the interaction inputs, and outputs, then we ask questions:

1. How can you use this model to do this functionality(and we specify the functionality: to control the TV, Conacts, Blinds)?(to evaluate Model complixity to the user)
2. Will you be comfortable to use this model in front of other people?(to evaluate acceptability)
3. How frequent you will use this interaction or that? (to evaluate useability)
4. Can you list the advantages and disadvantages?
5. Can you please comment on the difficulty of usage?(any pain or issues?)
