## Tangible Model Interview

---

### Unstructured interviews

- most like a conversation, often go into depth
- open questions
- exploratory

>absolute key is to listen rather than talk: practice silence!

#### pros/cons

[2]

|   Advantages  |  Limitations  |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| Can provide **more detailed information** than other data collection methods, such as surveys      | Can be **time-intensive** because of the time it takes to conduct interviews, transcribe them, and analyze the results |
| May provide a **more relaxed atmosphere** in which to collect information through conversation, in comparison to filling out a survey  | **Interviewer must be appropriately trained** in interviewing techniques in order to extract the most detailed and rich data from an interviewee  |
| Interviewee can provide firsthand and more personal knowledge of a given topic that was not anticipated by the researcher | Not generalizable; generalizations about the results are usually incapable of being made because small samples are chosen and random sampling methods are not used |
|  | **Prone to bias**; responses from interviewees (community members, program participants, etc) might be biased due to their stake in the program |

### 1. Interview questions about user charastaristic

1. How old are you?
2. What kind of **physical** disorders do you have?
3. What kind of **cognitive** disorders do you have?
4. Do you need assistance in order to do your daily chores?
5. What is the level of the needed assistance on a scale of 6?

>This scale is graduated from 6 to 1, 6 represents independent persons for everyday life activities and 1 represents dependent persons with cognitive, physical, social, significant problems requiring a continued assistance[1].

### 2. Interview questions about Model intuitivity

First we introduce the shape of the model without further explanation, and we ask:

![Tangible Model](/img/Tangible.jpg)

1. What can you understand from this Model generally? (to evaluate intuitivity and simplicity)
2. How confident do you feel to use this Model to control appliances in your house? (to evaluate initial acceptability)
3. Does this Model seems to be easy to use? (to evaluate initial acceptability)
4. Is it easy to move from room to room? (to evaluate portability)

### 3. Interview questions after explaining the describtion

We provide a detailed explanasion about the Model, and the interaction inputs, and outputs, then we ask questions:

1. Is there an ambiguous or unclear interaction?(to evaluate memorability and Model complixity)
2. Do you thing that we have to change something in the design?(to evaluate acceptability)
3. How frequent you will use this interaction or that? (to evaluate useability)
