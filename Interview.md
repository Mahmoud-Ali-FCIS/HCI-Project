## Tangible Model Interview

---

### Unstructured interviews

- most like a conversation, often go into depth
- open questions
- exploratory

>absolute key is to listen rather than talk: practice silence!

#### pros/cons

[2]

|   Advantages  |  Limitations  |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| Can provide **more detailed information** than other data collection methods, such as surveys      | Can be **time-intensive** because of the time it takes to conduct interviews, transcribe them, and analyze the results |
| May provide a **more relaxed atmosphere** in which to collect information through conversation, in comparison to filling out a survey  | **Interviewer must be appropriately trained** in interviewing techniques in order to extract the most detailed and rich data from an interviewee  |
| Interviewee can provide firsthand and more personal knowledge of a given topic that was not anticipated by the researcher | Not generalizable; generalizations about the results are usually incapable of being made because small samples are chosen and random sampling methods are not used |
|  | **Prone to bias**; responses from interviewees (community members, program participants, etc) might be biased due to their stake in the program |

### 1. Interview questions about user charastaristic

(Deng: I think 2-5 can be asked in a more comfortable way )

1. How old are you?
2. What is your gender?(Man - Woman - etc...)
3. What kind of **physical** disorders do you have? 
4. What kind of **cognitive** disorders do you have?
5. Do you need assistance in order to do your daily chores?
6. What is the level of the needed assistance on a scale of 6?

>This scale is graduated from 6 to 1, 6 represents independent persons for everyday life activities and 1 represents dependent persons with cognitive, physical, social, significant problems requiring a continued assistance[1].

### 2. Interview questions about Model intuitivity

First we introduce the shape of the model without further explanation, and we ask:

![Tangible Model](/img/Tangible2.jpg)

1. What can you understand from this Model generally? (to evaluate intuitivity and simplicity)
2. How confident do you feel to use this Model to control appliances in your house? (to evaluate initial acceptability)
3. How can you use this model to do this functionality(1 2 3)? (to evaluate initial acceptability)
4. Is it easy to move from room to room? (to evaluate portability)

> For question 1, an open question maybe more suitable. Like <u>could you tell me what possible meaning of the icons on the panel?</u> Then base on their reply, we can set a score for that. This is for the **ease-of-use** evaluation.
One question for **acceptability** is important: <u>Do you feel like using this interface?</u> Still more like an open question, we can also ask the user to give a scale.
Third, I assume the interface has duplicate in each room. Maybe we should discuss this.
**Commented by Deng**

### 3. Interview questions after explaining the describtion

We provide a detailed explanasion about the Model, and the interaction inputs, and outputs, then we ask questions:

1. Is there an ambiguous or unclear interaction?(to evaluate Model complixity)
2. Will you be comfortable to use this model in front of other people?(to evaluate acceptability)
3. How frequent you will use this interaction or that? (to evaluate useability)
4. Can you list the advantages and disadvantages?
5. Can you please comment on the difficulty of usage?(any pain or issues?)

>Still those questions are too straight forward. The interviewer may try to guess what we want instead of answering what they really think. For **Q2** here, we can ask: <u>Do you feel comfortable with this interface? If you have any ideas to improve it, please tell us.</u> And more questions like: <u> Is the organization of icon clear for you? </u>, <u>Do you think you need to remember what the icon mean when you use it? </u>
