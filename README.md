## Research Question

**Motivation:** To improve the daily life of the fragile elderly through technology. Because **Smart Home** is very useful for the elderly, as the living in a smart home can ease their everyday activities and in some cases might be the only way of enjoying autonomy without risks[7].

**Question:** Which Interaction approach among the three studied cases is the most suitable for elderly people, in the needs of the users. 
- physical disorders(hearing, sight, mobility)[1]
- cognitive level(memory disorders, learning ability)[1]

Then, find metrics that can help verify the design depending on this requirements.

**Objectives:** 
1. Design and evaluate different user interaction systems.
2. Compare systems using different metrics.

### ~~Difficulties and Challenges~~

1. ~~**Loss of memory.**~~
2. ~~**Physical limitations**: biological fragility is reflected in physical disorders such as hearing, sight[1].~~
3. ~~**Psychological challenges**: The proprioception degeneration which causes in the elderly a fear of falling and therefore limits outings [2], which causes a loneliness and a social fragility [3]. As well as the psychological fragility which implies a loss of identity [4-5] and a reassessment of its role within the society.~~

### Functionalities for the prototype[1]

- windows and blinds
- TV
- contact

They are the most wanted functionalities according to [1].

So, our design should be evaluated under target users' needs on those functionalites.

## Design Principles

Researchers [6] have created seven principles applied to universal design:

1. **Generality**, the design must take all users into account without stigmatizing them.
2. **Flixibility**, adapting to individual abilities.
3. **Simplicity**, the device must be understandable by all, independently of the user experience.
4. **Accessibility**, to make the information accessible in a multimodal way and to be able to use different supports. (operations can be performed anywhere, anytime)
5. **Security**, minimizing error risks and having security features.
6. **Efficiency**, the device should be used efficiently
with low cognitive and physical load.
7. **Portability**, take the space and size into account.

<!-- Other researchers[1] considered the design procedure as an iterative approach starting with needs analysis, defining specifications, design, and evaluation. And used scenarios, modelling, to project in the use of the device and to identify the desired features and interaction modes. -->

<!-- ### Designing Smart Home Controls for Elderly

Design requirements appropriate in the context of designing Smart Home controls for elderly[9]:
1. **Ease of use** Input modalities should be simple and easily recognized.
2. **Easy to handle** Product should have a reasonable size - not too small for elderly to handle, not too large to be unwieldy.
3. **No required knowledge** of the controlled devices internal workings, Product comes configured with the most common use-cases - or professional setup is provided.
4. **Not bound to a specific area** Users should be able to use the product from all places inside the house, they usually would want to use it from.
5. **Immediate feedback**, Product provides the user with information that their input did indeed change something;
6. **General purpose**, Product should be able to work with many different devices within it’s scope and not end up as one of many remote controls.
7. **Privacy** Product should not listen to the user’s every action, like speech and gesture recognition do, which could give elderly an uncomfortable feeling of being monitored. -->

## Evaluation Metrics

1. **Acceptability**:  is the characteristic of a thing being subject to acceptance for some purpose. A thing is acceptable if it is sufficient to serve the purpose for which it is provided([9]).
   
2. **Usability**: The extent to which a product can be used by specific users to achieve specific goals 
with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specific context of use[8].
   
   usability clearly differs from other system quality measures such as maintainability, reliability or portability in that the user point of view plays a determinant role in it. As a result, the objective of the interactive development cycle must not be only to obtain fully functional systems, but must also be concerned with the development of systems which adapt to the **user needs, expectations and goals**[7].

    **Nielsen’s Usability Attributes**
   - Learnability 
   - Efficiency
   - Memorability
   - Errors prevented
   - Subjective satisfaction
   
**Some metric we can use according to [10]**
  - System Usability Scale(SUS) and NASA-TLX are used as a subjective assessment tools to measure the **system usability** and **cognitive workload** in this study
  - usability: the time taken by the participants to memorise each set of commands 
  - usability: user performance error rate

## How to carry the evaluation?

1. Scenarios(as done in [1]).
2. Surveys(as done in [7]).
Used Survey with poll, to acquire useres expectations.

## Conclusion

**TBD** in Meeting

---

So thing we should care about:

   1. we choose the best model with our judgement
   2. implement protype
   3. evaluation usability
   4. questions with the user, and get their response from all the proposed models.
   5. draw some conclusions
